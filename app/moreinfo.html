            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Short track speed Skating</h2>
            <p>Short track speed skating is a form of competitive ice speed skating. Everything you know about ice
                sports can be overthrown in just a single start. Should you watch it, don't forget to keep breathing!
            </p>
            <p>A lot of people find it hard to believe, but it is one of the most exciting sports that I've ever seen.
                Many think it's only just skating in a circle (although it's ellipse) and nothing more. "The stronger
                you are, the better skater you are" - so many think, but in reallity the smarter you are, the better you
                are. It requires strategic positioning as well as on point reactions. Keep that in mind next time you
                are watching STSS.
            </p>
            <h2>History of STSS</h2>
            <p>Well STSS is not very very old sport, but it is definitely from the previous century. It was mainly
                practised in USA and Canada, but now South Korea is the undisturbed winner.</p>
            <p>I believe STSS will only grow in popularity - the comunity still doesn't know much about the sport, but
                every skater knows how exciting sport it is, and will definitely promote it if possible.</p>
            <h2>Become one of us</h2>
            <p>Last, but not least - Short track speed skating is not like figure skating or ice hokey... The sport is
                totally different from athletics, too. Should you wonder if that's the right sport for you or your
                children - definitely check it out. I promise you wont regret it.</p>
            <p>We would be very happy if you promote the sport. You don't need to remember all the details - the most
                important thing is that it is exciting, it is extreeme and it is<strong> worth it</strong>.</p>
