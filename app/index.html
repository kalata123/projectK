            <p class="detailed-text">Short track speed skating developed from speed skating events that were held with
                mass starts. This form of speed skating was mainly practised in the United States and Canada, as opposed
                to the international form, where athletes skated in pairs. At the 1932 Winter Olympics, speed skating
                events were conducted in the mass start form. Competitions in North America tended to be held indoors,
                for example in Madison Square Garden, New York, and therefore on shorter tracks than was usual for
                outdoor skating.
            </p>
            <p class="detailed-text">
                In 1967, the International Skating Union (ISU) adopted short track speed skating, although it did not
                organize international competitions until 1976. World Championships in short track speed skating have
                been officially held since 1981, although events held in 1976â€“1980 under different names have since
                received the status of World Championships retrospectively. The name of the competition was changed
                several times before it was eventually titled the "World Short Track Speed Skating Championships" in
                1989; the championships are now held annually.
