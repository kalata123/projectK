                <p class="intro-text">I don'r really like programming css or scss or web at all. So why do I have to go trough so much trouble</p>
                <p class="intro-text">I mean... This feels like being full stack developing... setting gulp, browser-sync, even some plumbers, next comes a few scripts and some servers, not to mention the real content I have to write....</p>

        <div class="main-detailed">
            <p class="main-intro-text">And now... let me tell you something about me - I don't really like programming...
            It's fun. <strong>Sometimes.</strong> But not that often. <br>
            The good part is that we are usually in groups and that's one big bonus... I mean you don't have to do everything alone, 
            you have someone to talk to when you wonder about something and stuff like that. Yes, this texts are really useless, 
            but at least it's not lorem ipsum... It is in the requirements... <br>
            Actually I need 5 not more... From the test 6 and now this 5 => 5.5 and then for the year 6... 
            Probably if I enjoyed it, I would have made something with the numbers... to express better the way I don't want to do this anymore...
            But hey, it's only 4 more templates :))</p>
